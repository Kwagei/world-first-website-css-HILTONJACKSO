                            The <a href="#"><strong>WWW</strong></a> project merges the techniques 
                            of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global
                            information system.
                            The project is based on the philosophy that much academic information 
                            should be freely available to anyone. It aims to allow 
                            information sharing within internationally dispersed teams, and the 
                            dissemination of information by support groups. Originally aimed at the High 
                            Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted much interest in 
                            user support, resource discovery and collaborative work areas.

                        <p>
                            The WWW world consists of documents, and links. Indexes 
                            are special documents
                            which, rather than being read, may be searched. The result of 
                            such a search is another 
                            ("virtual") document containing links to the documents found. A simple protocol
                            (" <a href="#"><strong> HTTP</strong></a> ") is used to allow a browser program to request a keyword search by a remote information server.
                            The web contains documents in many formats. Those documents which are hypertext, 
                            (real or virtual) contain links to other documents, or places within documents. 
                            All documents, whether real, virtual or indexes, look similar to the reader and
                            are contained within the same addressing scheme.

                            To follow a link, a reader clicks with a mouse (or types in a number if he or 
                            she has no mouse). To search and index, a reader gives keywords (or other search 
                            criteria). These are the only operations necessary to access the entire world of 
                            data.

                        <h2>Information provider view</h2>
                        <p>
                            The WWW browsers can access many existing data systems via existing protocols 
                            (FTP, NNTP) or via HTTP and a gateway. In this way, the critical mass of data is 
                            quickly exceeded, and the increasing use of the system by readers and information 
                            suppliers encourage each other.
                            Making a web is as simple as writing a few <a href="#"><strong> SGML</strong></a> files 
                            which point to your existing data. Making it public involves running the FTP or HTTP
                            <a href="#"><strong>daemon </strong></a> , and making at least one link into your web 
                            from another. In fact, any file available by anonymous FTP can be immediately linked 
                            into a web. The very small start-up effort is designed to allow small contributions. 
                            At the other end of the scale, large information providers may provide an HTTP server
                            with full text or keyword indexing. This may allow access to a large existing database
                            without changing the way that database is managed. Such gateways have already been made
                            into Digital's VMS/Help, Technical Univerity of Graz's "Hyper-G", and Thinking
                            Machine's "W.A.I.S." systems.

                            The WWW model gets over the frustrating incompatibilities of data format between 
                            suppliers and reader by allowing negotiation of format between a smart browser and a 
                            smart server. This should provide a basis for extension into multimedia, and allow those 
                            who share application standards to make full use of them across the web.

                            This summary does not describe the many exciting possibilities opened up by the WWW 
                            project, such as efficient document caching. the reduction of redundant out-of-date copies,
                            and the use of knowledge daemons. There is more information in the online project 
                            documentation, including some background on hypertext and many technical notes.

                            You can try the simple <a href="#"><strong> line mode browser</strong></a> 
                            by telnetting to info.cern.ch (no user or password. From UK JANET, use the <a href="#"><strong> 
                            Gateway)</strong></a>). You can also find out more about WWW in this way. This is the least 
                            sophisticated browser -- remember that the window-oriented ones are much smarter!
                            It is much more efficient to install a browser on your own machine. The line mode browser is 
                            currently available in source form by anonymous FTP from node info.cern.ch [currently 128.141.201.74] as

			                /pub/www/src/WWWLineMode_v.vv.tar.Z.

                            (v.vv is the version number - take the latest.)
                            Also available is <a href="#"><strong>  hypertext editor </strong></a> 
                            editor for the NeXT (WWWNeXTStepEditor_v.vv.tar.Z), the ViolaWWW browser for X11, and a 
                            skeleton server daemon (WWWDaemon_v.vv.tar.Z).
